# Introduction

The **FS Prober** package extends [react-dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/) by adding support for detecting empty folders, including deeply nested ones. It maintains full compatibility with `react-dropzone`, adhering to the same props and return types while enhancing its functionality.

While `react-dropzone` provides a simple React hook for creating an HTML5-compliant drag-and-drop zone, it has limitations in detecting empty folders, as noted in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone/issues/986#issuecomment-687603291).

FS Prober overcomes this limitation by using standard file system APIs, ensuring that even empty folders within a directory structure are correctly detected. It is tested with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari and supports both the [File and Directory Entries API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_and_Directory_Entries_API) and the [WICG File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API).

:::note

File and Directory Entries API is available in all latest browsers. But the WICG File System Access API might not be available in all browsers yet.
FS Prober uses File and Directory Entries API by default.

The FS Prober package extends the functionality of [`useDropzone`](https://react-dropzone.js.org/#usage) by using standard File System APIs, allowing it to detect even deeply nested empty folders.
